# RiskGT
This repository includes a remake and reimplementation of the board game RISK with modified rules and board. This program is created from the mixed work of Zach Allen, Rachit Bhargava, Hunter Copp, Sameh Hamadeh, and Haowei Li.

The game is currently not complete but has working features such as:
- Creating players
- Getting assigned armies, territories, and random turns
- Board is setup with a map including the territories and the armies it includes
- Allowing players to place new armies
- Allowing players to attack adjacent territories

The rest of the game and features are soon to come. The final game will include all the features and such of a regular RISK game and will be completely playable through running the program in this repo.

## Setting Up
Setting up the game is easy. Simply build and run the application.
Once the application is running, go to your browser and enter http://localhost:9000/ in the address bar.
Please note that providing information for the first three players is mandatory.
The next three players are optional but the information for these fields must be provided in sequential format,
meaning that Player 4 must exist for Player 5 / Player 6 to exist and Player 5 must exist for Player 6 to exist.

## Design Documentation
The design documentation is located at Design Documentations.docx

## Checking Initial Assignments
Checking initial assignments of the territory is easy.
Simply click on the territory on the map and see the information getting populated in Territory Information panel on the screen.
